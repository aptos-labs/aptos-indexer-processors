# Examples

Note: The intent is that users should be able to just copy the examples wholesale and use them without having to alter the dependencies in Cargo.toml. For now we use path dependencies for crates in this repo because we haven't published the framework crates yet, but later on we'll depend on the crates from crates.io, rather than referring to them by path / the workspace.
